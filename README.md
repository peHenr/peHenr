I'm PeHenr
Currently i'm learning Python. 
In 2017 i learned the basic concepts of C++ in a high school course, but bc of personal reasons I quit that course and now I'm very interessed on coding again.
I already learned the basics of Python and now I'm studying by making some little projects starting from the bottom and going ahead.
The next language I wanna learn is JS with HTML and CSS, so after that maybe go apply for a job in that area.
In the future after learn that languages that I mentioned, I'd like to learn more. I guess I discovered a new hobby, but this hobby may pay my bills in the future hehe
I'm Portuguese, sorry for my english :'D
